My first official website creation! 
This is a website for a restaurant called Maymar Poke and Grill in Norfolk, VA. I wanted to create a clean looking website that allowed customers to view information about the restaurant and what it has to offer.
It has the best Filipino food!

I focused on a mobile first approach and aligned most of the items centered.
