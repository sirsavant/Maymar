My first official website creation!

This is a website for a restaurant called Maymar Poke and Grill in Norfolk, VA.
It has the best Filipino food I have ever ate!

The information I wanted to add was basic information about the restaurant and what it had to offer. I focused on a mobile first approach and tried to keep most things centered and even.
